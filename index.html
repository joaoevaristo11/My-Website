                    <p>
                        I'm João Evaristo, a proactive final-year student in Network, Telecommunications & Software Engineering at ISEL. 
                        I combine a strong academic foundation in Network Protocols and simulation tools (GNS3, Packet Tracer) with self-taught 
                        software engineering skills. While my degree provided core knowledge in C, Java, and TCP/IP, I independently expanded 
                        my skillset to master modern tools like Python, Docker, and the MERN stack.
                    </p>
                    <p><br>
                        Beyond technology, I'm deeply passionate about sports and personal challenges. I've explored various disciplines throughout 
                        my life — swimming, handball, basketball — but football captured my heart, where I competed as a federated athlete for over 
                        7 years. Recently, I've discovered my love for fitness and running, having already completed a half marathon with ambitious 
                        goals ahead. This athletic mindset reflects my approach to life: setting high targets and relentlessly pursuing them.
                    </p>
                    <p><br>
                        My greatest ambition is to become one of the best in my field and, through my work, provide everything my family needs. 
                        I am seeking a challenging opportunity to apply this hybrid profile, helping to build robust solutions while evolving 
                        alongside experienced professionals and bridging the gap between reliable network infrastructure and scalable software architecture.
                    </p>
